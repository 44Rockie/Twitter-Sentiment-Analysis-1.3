# A basic Twitter Sentiment Analysis program that does not require Twitter API keys or access tokens.  The first several
# attempts at creating a Twitter Sentiment Analysis program, I was having a great deal of difficulty getting Tweepy
# to search and authorize the access to scrape tweets from Twitter and spent around 7 hours trying to go down that route
# for the program. Since python is such a great coding environment in that it has multiple routes and methods, libraries
# and ways to accomplish similar tasks I began researching different methods to perform sentiment analysis on tweets.
# The total time it took for me to complete the assignment was around 14 hours with all the research and then the coding
# and running the program to ensure it was working correctly. I ended up using pandas, datetime, re,and nltk
# libraries to create a program that would scrape tweets and analyze sentiment.
# While several assignments ago I initially had difficulty downloading and importing nltk, it has been a powerful API
# that has enabled me to successfully complete several assignments now and I am huge fan of it!
