# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-1.3
Developed by Grady Morris

This is a simple program that allows the user to scrape tweets from Twitter and analyze their sentiment and 
place them into three categories based on the analysis, positive, negative, and neutral. The program has simple user 
interface that allows the user to continue to search different subjects from Tweets on Twitter or to allow the
user to exit cleanly from the program.  The program allows the user to search specify the subject of their
search, the number of tweets they want to return from their search, and the number of previous days for their search
to entail. The program returns the tweets and displays a count of the positive, negative, and neutral tweets,
as well as groups them into their categories and then displays the tweet's text.  The program removes extraneous items
from the tweets such as hashtags, retweets, mentions, and hyperlinks.
